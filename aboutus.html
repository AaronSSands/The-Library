    <h4> History of "The Library":</h4>
    <p>The founders of "The Library" Aaron and Jennifer had two different views and ideas when starting a company; Aaron wanted
        a fine dining experence with the taste of great and amazing foods from aorund the world and Jennifer wanted a
        more library bar feel where people could come and enjoy a good book, food, and drinks.</p>

        where you can not only get a good book but a place where you can enjoy amazing food from the writiers you find enjoyment
        in reading with, you get first class food from your favorite writiers time period and not only there time period but dishes
